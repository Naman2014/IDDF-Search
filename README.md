# IDDF-Search
I spearheaded the implementation of the Iterative Deepening Depth First Search (IDDFS) algorithm as a pivotal cornerstone of a comprehensive route planning project. This initiative, which unfolded under the esteemed guidance of Dr. Bhargab Maitra at IIT Kharagpur throughout the period spanning from January 2023 to February 2023, presented a unique opportunity to delve into the intricacies of cutting-edge technology in the field of travel logistics.

My role in this project extended far beyond mere algorithmic execution. It encompassed the design, development, and fine-tuning of a sophisticated and intuitive route planning system. This system was meticulously engineered to cater to the diverse needs of travelers seeking to navigate through terrain that ranged from the unfamiliar to the complex.

One of the paramount achievements of this project was the facilitation of seamless and expedited route discovery, thereby addressing the perennial challenge of optimizing travel efficiency. By harnessing the computational prowess of the IDDFS algorithm, I effectively bridged the gap between theoretical concepts and practical utility, resulting in a tangible enhancement of the travel experience for end-users.

This undertaking underscored not only my proficiency in algorithm implementation but also my innate ability to tackle complex problem-solving scenarios. It underscored my unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of travel technology to usher in an era of enhanced efficiency and elevated user satisfaction.
